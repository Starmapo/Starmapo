### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy trying to code in HaxeFlixel for Friday Night Funkin' and that's really all I will do here. Currently working on my fork of Psych Engine. Btw it's privated until it's actually ready to be used.

My pronouns are he/him but you can use they/them idc I'm not gonna throw a hissy fit.
