# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Flainn, a guy trying to make some silly stuff. You can also call me Star, my username on sites is usually Starmapo.

You can find more of my links through my website on my profile.

## Skills

I've learnt [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) well enough since 2021, and I can code games using the [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) game engine. Particularly, I have a lot of experience with making modifications for the game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) and its fan-made engines. I've made some contributions to HaxeFlixel itself, including [a new text input object](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/pull/3219).

## Repositories I've contributed to

- [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel): Free, cross-platform 2D game engine powered by Haxe and OpenFL
- [haxeui-core](https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-core): The core library of the HaxeUI framework
- [haxeui-flixel](https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-flixel): The Flixel backend of the HaxeUI framework
